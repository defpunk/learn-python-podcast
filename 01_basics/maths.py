# double * is  the "exponentiation" or "power" operator.
# It is used to calculate the result when a number (the base) is raised to the power of another number
# The example below is how to calculate 2 to the power of 3 i.e 2 * 2 * 2
print('2 ** 3 = ' + str(2 ** 3))

print('10 / 3 = ' + str(10 / 2))
# double / is the floor division operator it always returns a whole number
# - programmers refer to these as integers usually shortened to int
print('10 // 3 = ' + str(10 // 3))
# % is the modulus operator it returns the remainder after division.
print('10 % 3 = ' + str(10 % 3))
